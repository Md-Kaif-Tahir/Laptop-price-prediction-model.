## Key Findings

- Gaming laptops tend to be the most expensive due to their need for high-performance components, especially those with top-tier specifications. This segment is largely dominated by Nvidia graphics, with AMD having a smaller share in the laptop market.
- The 16-inch screen size is the most popular, reflecting the common preference for a balanced and versatile display. Additionally, laptops with 8GB RAM are prevalent, offering a sweet spot that not only serves current needs but also allows for potential future upgrades.
- Windows 10 stands out as the most widely used operating system in the laptop market. Apple notebooks predominantly run on macOS, and Linux, particularly favored in the cybersecurity field, holds a notable presence as well.
