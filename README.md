## Key Findings

- Gaming laptops tend to be the most expensive due to their need for high-performance components, especially those with top-tier specifications. This segment is largely dominated by Nvidia graphics, with AMD having a smaller share in the laptop market.
- The 16-inch screen size is the most popular, reflecting the common preference for a balanced and versatile display. Additionally, laptops with 8GB RAM are prevalent, offering a sweet spot that not only serves current needs but also allows for potential future upgrades.
- Windows 10 stands out as the most widely used operating system in the laptop market. Apple notebooks predominantly run on macOS, and Linux, particularly favored in the cybersecurity field, holds a notable presence as well.

## Business Problem

In the ever-evolving laptop market, businesses face the challenge of predicting the prices of laptops accurately. This is crucial for several reasons, including optimizing inventory management, setting competitive pricing strategies, and meeting customer expectations. An inaccurate prediction could lead to overstocking, tying up valuable resources, or underpricing, resulting in potential revenue loss. Understanding the factors influencing laptop prices, such as specifications, operating systems, and brand preferences, is essential for businesses to make informed decisions and stay competitive in the dynamic market. Developing a reliable prediction model for laptop prices is not just a statistical challenge; it directly impacts the bottom line and overall success of businesses operating in the laptop retail space.
